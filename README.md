## **Amazon Sales Analysis:**
This project aims to analyze sales data from three different branches of Amazon located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. By exploring various aspects of the sales data, including product lines, sales trends, customer segments, and profitability, we seek to gain insights into factors influencing sales performance across different branches.

## **Crime Data Analysis with MySQL and Python:** 
In this project, we use python, specially Pymysql library to interact with a MySQL database in order to analyze and gain insights from crime data by performing data exploration, data analysis and data visualization.

## **Statistical & EDA for Netflix Insights:** 
This project contains an analysis of a Netflix dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The analysis focuses on uncovering insights, cleaning the data, and visualizing scenarios to provide valuable insights into Netflix viewership trends, content preferences, and audience demographics.
