## **Exploring Coffee Quality Data with Power BI:**
Analyzed CQI's dataset to identify factors influencing coffee quality using Power BI. Key findings included significant sensory attributes, correlations between processing methods and quality scores, and trends in defect occurrences. The project provided insights to improve coffee standards and support the specialty coffee industry.

## **Amazon Sales Analysis:**
This project aims to analyze sales data from three different branches of Amazon located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. By exploring various aspects of the sales data, including product lines, sales trends, customer segments, and profitability, we seek to gain insights into factors influencing sales performance across different branches.

## **OTP Verification System:** 
The OTP Verification System project aims to streamline user authentication by generating and validating one-time passwords (OTPs). Through Python, this system ensures secure access to sensitive information or actions by sending unique OTPs via email. With an emphasis on simplicity and reliability, it offers a seamless user experience while prioritizing security

## **Laptop Price Prediction:**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for SmartTech Co. to predict laptop prices accurately, aiding in competitive market positioning. Challenges include diverse specifications, real-time predictions, and interpretability. Project phases include data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, tuning, real-time predictions, and insights presentation. Expected outcomes are a reliable pricing model and strategic insights.

## **Crime Data Analysis with MySQL and Python:** 
In this project, we use python, specially Pymysql library to interact with a MySQL database in order to analyze and gain insights from crime data by performing data exploration, data analysis and data visualization.

## **Statistical & EDA for Netflix Insights:** 
This project contains an analysis of a Netflix dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The analysis focuses on uncovering insights, cleaning the data, and visualizing scenarios to provide valuable insights into Netflix viewership trends, content preferences, and audience demographics.
